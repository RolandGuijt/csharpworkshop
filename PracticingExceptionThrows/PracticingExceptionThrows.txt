Practicing Exception Throws

- Create a class Person with an Age property
- A valid age is in the range 0-100.
- If an invalid age is set, throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException (in the System namespace)
- Create an instance of the class and set an invalid age
- Observe what happens when you run
- Catch the exception

- Create a new class AgeOutOfRangeException. Derive from ArgumentOutOfRangeException
- Throw the new exception instead in the Person class
- Observe the effects with and without the catch.
- What could be a benefit of using the derived class instead of the more generic one?
