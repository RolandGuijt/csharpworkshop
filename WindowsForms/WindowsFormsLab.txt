Windows Forms Lab

- Create a new Windows Forms application
- Add a class Customer to it with Name, Address and City properties.
- Add a new form to it called CustomerForm. Add TextBox components and Labels for each of the customer properties.
- In the CustomerForm class create a property with a getter that constructs a new Customer filling in the properties using the textboxes.

- In the main form add a button. In the click event handler create an instance of the form and show it using the ShowDialog method.
- In the main form, get the customer information by reading the property in CustomerForm and display it using Label components

- Take a step back: study all code that was generated for you: the components that are created, the events used, the partial classes etc.
