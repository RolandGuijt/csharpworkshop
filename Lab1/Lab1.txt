Lab 1

1. Create a new console application in Visual Studio. Right click on the project in solution explorer, go to properties and under build => General set Nullable to false. Roland will explain this setting later.

2. Create a program that picks a random number and let the user guess the number. It should indicate if users guessed correctly or not and the number should be in the 1-10 range.

In addition to everything Roland just explained (see slides PDF for reference), you'll need this line of code to get the random number:

var randomNumber = new Random().Next(10) + 1;

3. If the number was incorrect, show the user if the number was higher or lower than the guessed one in addition to the correct number.

4. If time allows: add some nice text colors by using Console.ForegroundColor and/or Console.BackgroundColor.
