Lab 2

1. Enhance the application from lab 2: Instead of revealing the correct number after the first guess, give the user another go until the correct number is guessed.

2. Show the number of guesses it took after the number was guessed.

3. If time allows: Limit the number of guesses to 3. When the game is over, show if there's a winning condition or not together with a summary of the numbers that the user tried.
