Lab 3

Create a new application and create a non-graphical, one player version of the game "Snakes and Ladders" aka "Chutes and Ladders". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders

During the game let the players roll a die when a key is pressed and show the current position on the board when the position changes. 
Notify the player when a snake or ladder is encountered.
When the player completes a game show how many turns it took to reach the end.

In this version squares with a snake sets the player back a fixed 10 steps and squares with a ladder advance the player 10 steps.

Hints:

- Create two arrays containing the square numbers for the snakes and the ladders.
- Arrays have a Contains function that checks if a certain element is present.

Advanced/when time allows: Instead of using the fixed penalty/bonus for a snake/ladder can you think of a way to let each snake/ladder have its own unique penalty/bonus? If so, implement it :-)
