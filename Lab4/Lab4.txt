Lab 4

Create an object oriented version of Snakes and Ladders.

- Create a class representing a square. It should have a number property, a modifier property and properties that designate it as a snake or ladder.
- Create a game class that will contain the game engine. Add a start method that runs the game.
- Instead of using an array with numbers, now use an array with square objects. Fill the array in a separate method and in two other methods, determine which squares are snakes and ladders with which modifiers.
- Instead of keeping the current position in an integer, now use a Square instance.

- Instantiate the game class in program.cs and call the start method. When start completes, show the number of turns it took when the game finishes.
