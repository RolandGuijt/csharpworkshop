Lab 5

Add inheritance to Snakes and Ladders.

- Modify the Square class so that it just contains the property that represents the square number.
- Create a class SpecialSquare that derives from Square containing a string property Message and an int property Modifier.
- Create the SnakeSquare and LadderSquare classes that derive from SpecialSquare. They should override the Modifier and Message properties.
- Modify the game class to make it work with this new structure.

Hints:
- The methods that create the ladders and snakes now should instantiate SnakeSquare/LadderSquare objects.
- To determine if a snake or ladder square is reached, the game should use the "is" operator to see if the current position square is a SpecialSquare.
